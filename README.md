# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
To navigate the maze, I programmed a Finch Robot to manuveur through the walls to reach the end. By using simple "setMove" functions, I was able have the robot move forward an exact distance. The software was super easy to use and made it easy to control the precise distance I wanted the Finch Robot to travel. I used "setTurn" to turn the  Finch Robot a certain amount of degrees to the left or right which helped me control the direction the robot was moving.

## Challenges faced and solutions
Some challenges I faced was putting the Finch Robot in the exact same spot every single time I tested it in order to keep each test consistent. One way I fixed this issue was by making a set point that I kept track of in order to keep the Robot's position the same. I lined up the left side of the back wing of the robot to the start of the "S" in the word "start" at the beginning of the maze. This cut down the amount of variables in each of my tests and made each test more consistent. Another challenge I faced was figuring out how far the Finch Robot would need to travel before turning. To solve this, I used a meter stick to measure out all the distances. After measuring it, I made a visual layout of the maze on a piece of paper and wrote down each major measurement I needed. Then I wrote the code accordingly.

## Future enhancements
Some future enhancements I could have added is some event that happens at the end of the maze. Once the Finch Robot completes the maze, I could have added a feature where the robot looks like it is dancing as a celebration for completing the maze. Another feature I could have added was a feature that I saw from other groups in which they added a tiny sound that played from the Finch Robot on each turn. I don't think these are major enhancements but rather a feature that would make the robot more appealing to the user.
